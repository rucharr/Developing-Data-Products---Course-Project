# Developing-Data-Products---Course-Project

The project here is divided in two parts
A) Shiny app
In this app we have used Diamond dataset from ggplot package to assess what determines the prices of diamonds apart from carots. It contains two files server.R and ui.R. If you run these files in your R studio an interactive app will open.

B) Producible pitch
This is a presentation outlining the Diamond data and also contains the Git link.
